🌍 AQI Dashboard – Air Quality Analysis using Machine Learning & Python

Welcome to the AQI Dashboard, a powerful web application built with Python and Machine Learning that visualizes and analyzes Air Quality Index (AQI) data across regions. This project empowers users to explore pollution levels, identify trends, and visualize AQI through rich and interactive visualizations.
🚀 Features

📈 Data Visualization

📊 Pollution Levels – View average pollution by city, state, or pollutant

📅 Time-Based Trends – Analyze AQI trends over time (if temporal data is available)

🔍 Pollutant Comparison – Visualize pollution distribution via bar charts, box plots

🗺️ Heatmaps/Maps – Explore spatial distribution using interactive maps

🧠 Analysis

🏙️ Top Polluted Locations – Find the most polluted cities or stations

📋 AQI Classification – Categorized insights: Good, Moderate, Poor, etc.

⚗️ Dominant Pollutants – Identify the most significant pollutants per state

🗺️ Mapping 

📍 Station Mapping – Plot station locations using Plotly Express or Folium

🌐 Interactive map view to explore real-world AQI stations

💡 Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation
